    "The LLM that we will use in this assignment is Meta Llama 3.1 (8B). (We are deliberately not using Llama 3.1 Instruct, which is the instruction-tuned or “chat model”. The instruction-tuned model is even more capable on math word problems. However, the techniques that we will explore are also useful when working with instruction-tuned model to solve harder problems than math word problems.) Although it is a relatively small LLM, it is very capable for its size. The following code shows you how to query it:"

To find out how many candies each person gets, we divide the total number of candies by the number of people. 15 ÷ 5 = 3 candies per person. So, each person gets 3 candies.\n",
