To run the project:

* Ensure all necessary libraries are installed. Most are standard data science libraries: some that might be missing are gradio, chromadb, and kagglehub

* Run webapp.py (or webapp_real_jobs.py - the vector database for this is large and cannot be uploaded to Gradescope or GitHub, so you will have to run get_19000_postings.py to get the database locally if you want to run webapp_real_jobs.py)

This was tested on Python 3.11
