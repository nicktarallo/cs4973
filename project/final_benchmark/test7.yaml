# This test is mainly meant to test whether the user can call tools without actually every calling the find jobs tool. There is no reason that this should not work,
# so we expect these tests to pass.

# However, it at times misinterprets the initial prompt and responds with text instead of pure code, resulting in a failing benchmark.

- prompt: I was talking to you earlier, I was interested in job 56, but I can't remember what the description looked like.
  expected_type: show-job-description
  expected_result: 56

- prompt: What skills should I work on to get that job?
  expected_type: skills-gap
  expected_result: 56

- prompt: Ok, looks like I still have a bit to work on. Why don't you write me a cover letter anyways?
  expected_type: cover-letter
  expected_result: 56

- prompt: Just apply for me, that would be really helpful
  expected_type: apply
  expected_result: 56
  cover_letter: true

- prompt: Apply again so I have a better chance
  expected_type: apply
  expected_result: null
  cover_letter: false
