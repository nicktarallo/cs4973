# This trivial prompt is from our initial benchmark set. It tests to see whether the chatbot will successfully answer questions when tools are not necessary since
# the resume/job description are provided in the prompts.

# Interestingly, our benchmark sometimes fail on this prompt that should be somewhat trivial since it tries to write code to solve it even though it is not necessary. This is
# likely because our system prompt and few-shot prompting is biased towards code. We tried to improve this by adding a few shot-user-assistant interaction where no code was created.
# The code it tried to create was ```def work_on_cpp_projects(self):```
# Additionally, after encountering this, we added an ErrorResponse as another subclass of AgentResponse. Previously, in the case of error, we were just catching and returning the code as
# a TextResponse, but we decided that this was not desired behavior.

# At other times, it tries to use the find_jobs tool even though its not necessary
