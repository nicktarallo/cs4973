# This is intended to test the ability of the model to recall details from earlier in the conversation when the user
# asks about the Google job much later. It also tests the ability of the model to answer one-off questions about the job description
# such as the third prompt.

# Sometimes, it fails and we encounter this error AttributeError("'ShowJobDescriptionResponse' object has no attribute 'company'")
# The model tries to access a company attribute that doesn't exist. It is supposed to just refer to previous context since the company is available there.
