# This is an example of a fairly simple sequence of prompts that should result in tool calls. It also tests the inclusion of a cover letter after being written for a job, while not including
# it with another job that was asked to apply to.
# Additionally, it makes sure that the user cannot apply to the same job twice, while also testing some recall from previous turns.

- prompt: Find me jobs based on my resume
  expected_type: find-jobs
  expected_result: [80, 77, 0, 20, 60]

- prompt: Write a cover letter for the 4th one
  expected_type: cover-letter
  expected_result: 20

- prompt: Now apply to it for me
  expected_type: apply
  expected_result: 20
  cover_letter: true

- prompt: Can you apply to it again?
  expected_type: apply
  expected_result: null
  cover_letter: false

- prompt: Oh darn, I was hoping to apply twice. Well, at the very least, can you also apply to the first job that came up?
  expected_type: apply
  expected_result: 80
  cover_letter: false
