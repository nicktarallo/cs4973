# This is an example where we are testing very difficult prompts like applying to up to 3 jobs at once, and also doing a cover letter and application in one turn.
# It often fails on the second prompt, as it is difficult for the model to synthesize the correct code to apply for three jobs.

- prompt: Hey! You have my resume, why don't you find me some useful jobs based on it.
  expected_type: find-jobs
  expected_result: [80, 77, 0, 20, 60]

- prompt: Thanks a lot. Can you apply to the first three?
  expected_type: apply
  expected_result: 0
  cover_letter: false

- prompt: Show me the description for the last one as well
  expected_type: show-job-description
  expected_result: 60

- prompt: Write me a cover letter and then apply to that one as well
  expected_type: apply
  expected_result: 60
  cover_letter: true
