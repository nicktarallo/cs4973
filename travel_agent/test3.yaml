# This is a test that checks the of the model to infer a bit more, with multiple bookings in a row and date relationships being used rather
# than explicit dates. The second date is dependent on the first date,
# so it tests the reasoning of the model in terms of dates to either add 7 days itself, or use code to add 7 days to the previous date.
# Some odd behavior that sometimes occurs here is that the last book flight call sometimes includes text along with the code, which messes with
# the parsing of the text since it is not clear whether to run it as code or not. To combat this, a message was added in the system prompt to
# make sure it doesn't include text when returning code. This mostly fixed the issue, but every once in a while, the fourth step may fail
# resulting in an accuracy of 0.6 instead of 1.0.
