# This tests the models ability to answer specific questions about the flights that it found prior to booking. We made this possible and
# improved our results here by including the results of previous tool calls in the 
# conversation history itself above the user's request so that the model has context
# to answer other questions with. Then, we are able to book based on the model's answers to those questions. Then, the user asks various
# questions about the booking and airline policies to see if the model will try to answer them to the best of their ability without
# trying to write code where it isn't necessary.

# Sometimes it was writing code not in markdown backticks, which would then result in a text response rather than the necessary find flights or
# book flight response. We improved this with an additional instruction in the system prompt to tell it to always put code in backticks.
