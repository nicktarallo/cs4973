# One initial challenge with this test case was that the model was assuming that the person was leaving from New York since the 
# origin was not clearly stated. It was therefore inferring from the few-shot prompting earlier in the conversation that the 
# origin was New York since it was in those parts of the conversation. To fix this, we modified the early turns used for few-shot
# to make it clear that it should not be assumed NYC is the origin for future cases.

# Another challenge that rises with this case is when the user asks to try booking for the second time, it switches to the other
# flight rather than trying to book the one that the user asked for. This causes the result of book flight to not be null since the
# other flight is bookable. There is not an easy way to fix this since it is due to poor interpretation of the user's intent by the model.
# Sometimes, it interprets the user correctly and gets 1.0 accuracy, but this is not very common.
