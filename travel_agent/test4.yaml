# One initial challenge with this test case was that the model was assuming that the person was leaving from New York since the 
# origin was not clearly stated. It was therefore inferring from the few-shot prompting earlier in the conversation that the 
# origin was New York since it was in those parts of the conversation. To fix this, we modified the early turns used for few-shot
# to make it clear that it should not be assumed NYC is the origin for future cases.

# An additional challenge that came up when we added the ability to search between two dates is that it includes both the travel date and
# the game date for its find flights call, when it should only be including the travel date. This new feature helped with some other test
# cases, but seems to have caused an issue here. This is poor interpretation of date logic from the user and is hard to fix without
# messing up other test cases.

# Another challenge that rises with this case is when the user asks to try booking for the second time, it switches to the other
# flight rather than trying to book the one that the user asked for. This causes the result of book flight to not be null since the
# other flight is bookable. There is not an easy way to fix this since it is due to poor interpretation of the user's intent by the model.
# Sometimes, it interprets the user correctly and gets 1.0 accuracy, but this is not very common.
