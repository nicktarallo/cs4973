# Alternative Flight Booking Conversation Sequence
# We included this test to check for its ability to look at multiple dates with reference to terms like "next week" and "Tuesday through Thursday"
# While we were able to improve the performance for multiple dates by adding a date range search to find_flights, which helped a little, it generally
# struggles with terms like next week, as it doesn't seem to be able to compute when next week starts (either Sunday or Monday), and generally
# just goes out 7 days from today (or 7 days from one week from now, neither of which would be what the user is intending since the start date is a Friday,
# so next week would just start 2-3 days out)
