# This test is meant to challenge the model by having multiple origins and destinations. Originally, our find flights tool could only take
# one origin and one destination, which challenged the model to write code that would use the tool call for each potential combination of
# origin/destination and build the result list by adding them together. This was pretty hit or miss, as it would either do this correctly and
# get 1.0 accuracy or get 0.0 accuracy if it didn't do it right. We improved our find flights tool to take in a list of origins and a list of
# destinations (as well as start and dates to specify a range, which is useful for a different test). This makes it a lot easier on the model,
# so it can just call the tool with a list rather than having to generate additional code itself to properly account for all combinations.
# This resulted in more consistent 1.0 accuracy results. One other challenge we got was that it would sometimes include all four days in find_flights
# This was improved with an additional instruction in the system prompt to make sure to only include the actual flight dates in find_flights.
