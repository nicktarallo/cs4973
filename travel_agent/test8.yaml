# This test is meant to see how good the agent is at coming up with strategies on its own when we ask to book a flight that did not
# exist in the search results, or when we try to filter flights based on airline, which is not a built in feature of our find flights tool.

# There are a few challenges with the model here. One limitation of the model here is that it has trouble interpreting what a week-long trip is
# If the trip is one week, the return should be on the seventh day, but the model usually writes code that searches for the return on the eighth day.
# Also, the user asks to book Delta for the return trip even though none of the flights are Delta. The model should refuse to book with text,
# but it would sometimes instead try to book a random flight from the results even though it was not Delta. We fixed this by adding an instruction 
# in the system prompt to not book if the airline the user asks for is not available for the flight. 
# Another thing that we test here is the ability for the model to filter after calling find_flights, so that it can filter out flights
# that are not delta (this is seen when we ask "Can you check 01/08/2023 for Delta?"). Since the find_flights tool doesn't have an
# airline filter, the model must be more ingenuitive with its code to filter it out after the tool call and before setting the final
# value of result. The model seems to be decent at this without us having to make modifications.
