    Reasoning: Sarah has 15 candies, and she needs to divide them equally among herself and 4 friends, which makes 5 people in total. To find out how many candies each person gets, we divide the total number of candies by the number of people. 15 รท 5 = 3 candies per person. So, each person gets 3 candies.

    Answer without units: 3

    Done
    

    Input: A bus can seat 40 people. If 5 buses are filled with passengers and there are 10 more people waiting to board, how many people in total need transportation?

    Reasoning: Each bus can hold 40 people. There are 5 buses, so the total number of people already seated in the buses is 5 * 40 = 200 people. Now, there are 10 more people waiting, so the total number of people that need transportation is the sum of those already seated and those waiting. Therefore, there are 200 + 10 = 210 people in total.

    Answer without units: 210

    Done


    Input: A library has 6 shelves. Each shelf holds 24 books. If the librarian adds 12 more books to one shelf, how many books are there in total now?
  
    Reasoning: The library initially has 6 shelves with 24 books on each shelf. The total number of books in the library before any additions is 6 * 24 = 144 books. Now, the librarian adds 12 more books to one shelf. So, the new total number of books becomes 144 + 12 = 156 books.
