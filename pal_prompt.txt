    num_people = 1 + 4  # Sarah and 4 friends
    candies_per_person = total_candies // num_people  # Integer division to find how many each person gets
    remaining_candies = total_candies % num_people  # Modulus to find leftover candies
    return candies_per_person, remaining_candies

candies_per_person, remaining_candies = question()
candies_per_person, remaining_candies  # This will return 3 and 0
```

### Prompt 2:
**Question:** A bus can seat 40 people. If 5 buses are filled with passengers and there are 10 more people waiting to board, how many people in total need transportation?

```python
def question():
    bus_capacity = 40
    num_buses = 5
    passengers_on_buses = num_buses * bus_capacity  # Total number of people seated in the buses
    waiting_people = 10
    total_people = passengers_on_buses + waiting_people  # Add the number of people waiting
    return total_people

total_people = question()
total_people  # This will return 210
```

### Prompt 3:
**Question:** A library has 6 shelves. Each shelf holds 24 books. If the librarian adds 12 more books to one shelf, how many books are there in total now?

    shelves = 6
    books_per_shelf = 24
    total_books = shelves * books_per_shelf  # Initial total books in the library
    added_books = 12
    total_books_now = total_books + added_books  # Add the new books to the total
    return total_books_now

total_books_now = question()
total_books_now  # This will return 156
```
