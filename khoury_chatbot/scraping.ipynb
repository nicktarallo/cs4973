Any exceptions to the course load requirement must be approved by the student’s academic advisor prior to the start of each semester. Pass/fail courses are restricted to electives outside of the major, minor, and NUpath requirements.\\n\\n\\n### GPA Requirements for Graduation\\n\\n\\nA minimum cumulative GPA requirement of 2\\\\.000 in major (CS/CY/DS/IS) courses and a minimum cumulative GPA requirement of 2\\\\.000 overall are required for graduation.\\n\\n\\n### Criteria for Academic Probation\\n\\n\\nFull\\\\-time students in Khoury College of Computer Sciences will be placed on academic probation effective for the following academic semester for any of the reasons noted below:\\n\\n\\n* Not earning at least 12 semester hours in each academic full\\\\-term semester (fall, spring)\\n\\n\\n* Not following a program of study approved by the student’s academic advisor\\n\\n\\n#### First\\\\-Year Students\\n\\n\\n* Not maintaining an overall cumulative GPA of at least 1\\\\.800 at the end of each full\\\\-term semester (fall, spring) of the first\\\\-year curriculum and a GPA of at least 2\\\\.000 in the major at the end of the second academic full\\\\-term semester of the curriculum (spring)\\n\\n\\n#### Upperclass and Transfer Students\\n\\n\\n* Not maintaining an overall cumulative GPA of at least 2\\\\.000 and a GPA of at least 2\\\\.000 in the major at the end of the second academic full\\\\-term semester of the curriculum completed on campus (fall or spring) and at the end of each full\\\\-term academic semester thereafter (fall, spring)\\n\\n\\n### Academic Dismissal from Major\\n\\n\\nNot maintaining a GPA of at least 2\\\\.000 in the major at the end of the third academic full\\\\-term semester and at the end of each full\\\\-term academic semester (fall, spring) thereafter will result in dismissal from Khoury College of Computer Sciences.\\n\\n\\nStudents not following a program of study approved by the student’s academic advisor for more than one semester may be dismissed from Khoury College of Computer Sciences.\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents dismissed from their major but who are otherwise eligible to remain an active student within the university may continue within Khoury College of Computer Sciences as a transitional major for one semester.\\n\\n\\n### Academic Dismissal from University\\n\\n\\nStudents who remain on probation after two full\\\\-term academic semesters may be dismissed from the university. This action may appear on the transcript at the end of the second probationary semester. In addition, students who have below a 1\\\\.000 GPA or fewer than 4 earned semester hours in any semester or cumulatively may be dismissed at the discretion of their college. Students may appeal this decision to the Academic Standing Committee of their college. International students must consult with an advisor in the [Office of Global Services](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/)to discuss the impact of an academic dismissal as it relates to nonimmigrant visa status.\\n\\n\\nProgram Length\\n--------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Khoury College of Computer Sciences prides itself on flexibility and a very supportive advising staff. Depending upon the number of entry\\\\-level/transfer credits, the academic program, and student planning, it is possible to complete the program within four years with at least one experiential experience and usually with two such experiences.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Campus Locations\\n\\n\\n* [Arlington   \\nVAOpens New Window](https://arlington.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Boston   \\nMAOpens New Window](https://www.northeastern.edu/campuses/boston/)\\n* [Burlington   \\nMAOpens New Window](https://www.burlington.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Charlotte   \\nNCOpens New Window](https://charlotte.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [London   \\nUKOpens New Window](https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/)\\n* [Miami   \\nFLOpens New Window](https://miami.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Nahant   \\nMAOpens New Window](https://csi.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Oakland   \\nCAOpens New Window](https://oakland.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Portland   \\nMEOpens New Window](https://roux.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Seattle   \\nWAOpens New Window](https://seattle.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Silicon Valley   \\nCAOpens New Window](https://siliconvalley.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Toronto   \\nONOpens New Window](https://toronto.northeastern.edu/)\\n* [Vancouver   \\nBCOpens New Window](https://vancouver.northeastern.edu/)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n* [Facebook.
