bring together three important frameworks from the humanistic social sciences for understanding the world around us. Computer science involves the application of theoretical concepts in the context of software development to the solution of problems that arise in almost every human endeavor, drawing on concepts and methods from mathematics, logic, science, and engineering. This interdisciplinary degree thus provides multiple perspectives and a set of skills that are indispensable in our increasingly interconnected world and essential in addressing the kinds of complex global problems future leaders need to tackle.\\n---\\nSample Plan of Study: Four Years, Two Co\\\\-ops in Summer 2/Fall\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Year 1 | |

mathematics\\xa0combined major was the first dual major created by the college. The mathematics requirements focus on courses that have computing applications or form the basis for further studies in mathematical theory. The program emphasizes the strong ties between computer science and mathematics that date back to the origins of machine computation in the 1930s and 1940s—and persist to this day.\\n---\\nSample Plan

mathematics\\xa0combined major was the first dual major created by the college. The mathematics requirements focus on courses that have computing applications or form the basis for further studies in mathematical theory. The program emphasizes the strong ties between computer science and mathematics that date back to the origins of machine computation in the 1930s and 1940s—and persist to this day.\\n---\\nSample Plan

This action may appear on the transcript at the end of the second probationary semester. In addition, students who have below a 1\\\\.000 GPA or fewer than 4 earned semester hours in any semester or cumulatively may be dismissed at the discretion of their college. Students may appeal this decision to the Academic Standing Committee of their college. International students must consult with an advisor in the [Office of Global Services](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/)to discuss the impact of an academic dismissal as it relates to nonimmigrant visa status.\\nProgram Length\\n--------------\\nThe Khoury College of Computer Sciences prides itself on flexibility and a very supportive advising staff.

combined major offers an integrative curriculum in the study of mind, brain, and behavior and in the collection, manipulation, storage, retrieval, and computational analysis of data in its various forms, including numeric, textual, image, and video data from small to large volumes.\\xa0The study of psychology draws upon empirical research with both humans and animals to investigate and seek explanations for the behavior and mental life of individuals and develop assessment tools and treatment options for addressing clinical problems. In this program, students have an opportunity to augment such knowledge with skills in big data analysis, data science, and data analytics.\\n---\\nSample Plan of Study:\\n---------------------\\nFour

bring together three important frameworks from the humanistic social sciences for understanding the world around us. Computer science involves the application of theoretical concepts in the context of software development to the solution of problems that arise in almost every human endeavor, drawing on concepts and methods from mathematics, logic, science, and engineering. This interdisciplinary degree thus provides multiple perspectives and a set of skills that are indispensable in our increasingly interconnected world and essential in addressing the kinds of complex global problems future leaders need to tackle.\\n---\\nSample Plan of Study: Four Years, Two Co\\\\-ops in Summer 2/Fall\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Year 1 | |

Science and Behavioral Neuroscience underscores how research in neuroscience has become a computational field of study. The combined major is designed for students who are interested in applying mathematical and computational methodologies toward understanding human behavior, artificial intelligence, and the human\\\\-machine interface. Courses across multiple science disciplines—including biology, chemistry, and computer science—lay a strong foundation necessary to explore brain mechanisms and how they give rise to behavioral functions and pathological states using computational approaches. Students will have an opportunity to develop skills in software development as they apply algorithms and data structures to brain research and neurotechnology.\\n---\\nSample
