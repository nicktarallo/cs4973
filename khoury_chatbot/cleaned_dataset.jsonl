Today, an understanding of computing is critical in business, healthcare, science, digital art, and other areas of our information\\-driven society. Computing knowledge and computing technology also contribute to resolving major issues in an increasingly complex world.\nThe Khoury College of Computer Sciences offers undergraduate programs that combine a strong foundation in computing with the opportunity to acquire a deep knowledge of another discipline in which computing plays a critical role. The college offers undergraduate degree programs in computer science (BS and BA), data science (BS), and cybersecurity (BS) and over 50 combined majors with partner departments in six other Northeastern University colleges, allowing students to engage in intense study in two disciplines. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science emphasizes strong technical competence in computer science, mathematics, science, and electrical engineering. The Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science combines computer science with a broad\\-based liberal arts education. The Bachelor of Science in Data Science combines computer science, information science, mathematics, statistics, and probability theory into an integrated curriculum. The Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity provides the fundamental knowledge of computer science with an essential focus on experiential learning through security\\-related courses.\n* [Academic Progression Standards](#text)\n+ [GPA Requirements for Graduation](#text)\n+ [Criteria for Academic Probation](#text)\n- [First\\-Year Students](#text)\n- [Upperclass and Transfer Students](#text)+ [Academic Dismissal from Major](#text)\n+ [Academic Dismissal from University](#text)* [Program Length](#text)\nAcademic Progression Standards\n------------------------------\nIn addition to meeting university progression standards, it is expected that full\\-time Khoury students enroll in four courses with appropriate labs and recitations and successfully complete at least 12 semester hours each academic semester with an acceptable grade\\-point average as noted below. Any exceptions to the course load requirement must be approved by the student\u2019s academic advisor prior to the start of each semester. Pass\/fail courses are restricted to electives outside of the major, minor, and NUpath requirements.\n### GPA Requirements for Graduation\nA minimum cumulative GPA requirement of 2\\.000 in major (CS\/CY\/DS\/IS) courses and a minimum cumulative GPA requirement of 2\\.000 overall are required for graduation.\n### Criteria for Academic Probation\nFull\\-time students in Khoury College of Computer Sciences will be placed on academic probation effective for the following academic semester for any of the reasons noted below:\n* Not earning at least 12 semester hours in each academic full\\-term semester (fall, spring)\n* Not following a program of study approved by the student\u2019s academic advisor\n#### First\\-Year Students\n* Not maintaining an overall cumulative GPA of at least 1\\.800 at the end of each full\\-term semester (fall, spring) of the first\\-year curriculum and a GPA of at least 2\\.000 in the major at the end of the second academic full\\-term semester of the curriculum (spring)\n#### Upperclass and Transfer Students\n* Not maintaining an overall cumulative GPA of at least 2\\.000 and a GPA of at least 2\\.000 in the major at the end of the second academic full\\-term semester of the curriculum completed on campus (fall or spring) and at the end of each full\\-term academic semester thereafter (fall, spring)\n### Academic Dismissal from Major\nNot maintaining a GPA of at least 2\\.000 in the major at the end of the third academic full\\-term semester and at the end of each full\\-term academic semester (fall, spring) thereafter will result in dismissal from Khoury College of Computer Sciences.\nStudents not following a program of study approved by the student\u2019s academic advisor for more than one semester may be dismissed from Khoury College of Computer Sciences.\nStudents dismissed from their major but who are otherwise eligible to remain an active student within the university may continue within Khoury College of Computer Sciences as a transitional major for one semester.\n### Academic Dismissal from University\nStudents who remain on probation after two full\\-term academic semesters may be dismissed from the university. This action may appear on the transcript at the end of the second probationary semester. In addition, students who have below a 1\\.000 GPA or fewer than 4 earned semester hours in any semester or cumulatively may be dismissed at the discretion of their college. Students may appeal this decision to the Academic Standing Committee of their college. International students must consult with an advisor in the [Office of Global Services](https:\/\/international.northeastern.edu\/ogs\/)to discuss the impact of an academic dismissal as it relates to nonimmigrant visa status.\nProgram Length\n--------------\nThe Khoury College of Computer Sciences prides itself on flexibility and a very supportive advising staff. Depending upon the number of entry\\-level\/transfer credits, the academic program, and student planning, it is possible to complete the program within four years with at least one experiential experience and usually with two such experiences.\n\n---"}

combined major offers an integrative curriculum in the study of mind, brain, and behavior and in the collection, manipulation, storage, retrieval, and computational analysis of data in its various forms, including numeric, textual, image, and video data from small to large volumes.\u00a0The study of psychology draws upon empirical research with both humans and animals to investigate and seek explanations for the behavior and mental life of individuals and develop assessment tools and treatment options for addressing clinical problems. In this program, students have an opportunity to augment such knowledge with skills in big data analysis, data science, and data analytics.\n---\nSample Plan of Study:\n---------------------\nFour

bring together three important frameworks from the humanistic social sciences for understanding the world around us. Computer science involves the application of theoretical concepts in the context of software development to the solution of problems that arise in almost every human endeavor, drawing on concepts and methods from mathematics, logic, science, and engineering. This interdisciplinary degree thus provides multiple perspectives and a set of skills that are indispensable in our increasingly interconnected world and essential in addressing the kinds of complex global problems future leaders need to tackle.\n---\nSample Plan of Study: Four Years, Two Co\\-ops in Summer 2\/Fall\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n| Year 1 | | | |

mathematics\u00a0combined major was the first dual major created by the college. The mathematics requirements focus on courses that have computing applications or form the basis for further studies in mathematical theory. The program emphasizes the strong ties between computer science and mathematics that date back to the origins of machine computation in the 1930s and 1940s\u2014and persist to this day.\n---\nSample

mathematics\u00a0combined major was the first dual major created by the college. The mathematics requirements focus on courses that have computing applications or form the basis for further studies in mathematical theory. The program emphasizes the strong ties between computer science and mathematics that date back to the origins of machine computation in the 1930s and 1940s\u2014and persist to this day.\n---\nSample

This action may appear on the transcript at the end of the second probationary semester. In addition, students who have below a 1\\.000 GPA or fewer than 4 earned semester hours in any semester or cumulatively may be dismissed at the discretion of their college. Students may appeal this decision to the Academic Standing Committee of their college. International students must consult with an advisor in the [Office of Global Services](https:\/\/international.northeastern.edu\/ogs\/)to discuss the impact of an academic dismissal as it relates to nonimmigrant visa status.\nProgram Length\n--------------\nThe Khoury College of Computer Sciences prides itself on flexibility and a very supportive advising staff. Depending upon the number of entry\\-level\/transfer credits, the academic program, and student planning, it is possible to complete the program within four years with at least one experiential experience and usually with two such experiences.\n\n---\nKhoury Combined Majors \\< Northeastern University Academic Catalog\n---\nAcademic Catalog 2024\\-2025\n---------------------------\nKhoury

combined major offers an integrative curriculum in the study of mind, brain, and behavior and in the collection, manipulation, storage, retrieval, and computational analysis of data in its various forms, including numeric, textual, image, and video data from small to large volumes.\u00a0The study of psychology draws upon empirical research with both humans and animals to investigate and seek explanations for the behavior and mental life of individuals and develop assessment tools and treatment options for addressing clinical problems. In this program, students have an opportunity to augment such knowledge with skills in big data analysis, data science, and data analytics.\n---\nSample Plan of Study:\n---------------------\nFour

combined major offers an integrative curriculum in the study of mind, brain, and behavior and in the collection, manipulation, storage, retrieval, and computational analysis of data in its various forms, including numeric, textual, image, and video data from small to large volumes.\u00a0The study of psychology draws upon empirical research with both humans and animals to investigate and seek explanations for the behavior and mental life of individuals and develop assessment tools and treatment options for addressing clinical problems. In this program, students have an opportunity to augment such knowledge with skills in big data analysis, data science, and data analytics.\n---\nSample Plan of Study:\n---------------------\nFour

bring together three important frameworks from the humanistic social sciences for understanding the world around us. Computer science involves the application of theoretical concepts in the context of software development to the solution of problems that arise in almost every human endeavor, drawing on concepts and methods from mathematics, logic, science, and engineering. This interdisciplinary degree thus provides multiple perspectives and a set of skills that are indispensable in our increasingly interconnected world and essential in addressing the kinds of complex global problems future leaders need to tackle.\n---\nSample Plan of Study: Four Years, Two Co\\-ops in Summer 2\/Fall\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n| Year 1 | | | |

Science and Behavioral Neuroscience underscores how research in neuroscience has become a computational field of study. The combined major is designed for students who are interested in applying mathematical and computational methodologies toward understanding human behavior, artificial intelligence, and the human\\-machine interface. Courses across multiple science disciplines\u2014including biology, chemistry, and computer science\u2014lay a strong foundation necessary to explore brain mechanisms and how they give rise to behavioral functions and pathological states using computational approaches. Students will have an opportunity to develop skills in software development as they apply algorithms and data structures to brain research and neurotechnology.\n---\nSample

mathematics\u00a0combined major was the first dual major created by the college. The mathematics requirements focus on courses that have computing applications or form the basis for further studies in mathematical theory. The program emphasizes the strong ties between computer science and mathematics that date back to the origins of machine computation in the 1930s and 1940s\u2014and persist to this day.\n---\nSample
